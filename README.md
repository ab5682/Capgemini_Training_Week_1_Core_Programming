## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Introduction to Java

- What is Java?
- Brief history and its ecosystem
- Setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Writing and running your first Java program: `Hello, World!`

- Declaring and initializing variables
- Primitive types: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.
- Non-primitive type: `String` (intro)
- Java Operators: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment
- Type casting (implicit and explicit)

### Day 2: Control Flow

- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- `switch` statement
- Looping with `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
- Using `break` and `continue`

### Day 3: Arrays

- What are arrays and why use them?
- Declaring, initializing, and accessing arrays
- Iterating through arrays using loops
- Multi-dimensional arrays

### Day 4: Methods
- What are methods and why use them?
- Declaring and defining methods
- Calling methods
- Method parameters and return types 

### Day 5: Strings

- `String` class basics
- Creating and comparing strings
- Common methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `equals()`, `equalsIgnoreCase()`
- String concatenation and immutability

### Extras: Built In Function and String

- What are built in function and how to use it
